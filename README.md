# Scrolling Bitmap game
A simple 2D helicopter survival game using scrolling bitmaps based on a tutorial I found on youtube by 
[paymon wang-lotfi](https://www.youtube.com/user/Paymon112233). 

The youtube edition was very promising, but unfortunately never evolved above a certain stage. Hence I have improved it by cleaning up 
here and there, added sound effects and saved highscore in persistent memory.
